# Capstone Project

#The idea of this project is to provide a private digital library for readers to use in order to track what books they are reading or books that they want to read as well as tracking books that they currently are reading, the pages that they have read and what page they are on, and what books are finished.
#The project scope is to create an interactive personal library in which an individual can manage a variety of books, such as books they are reading, books they want to read, and books that they have completed.  Features that will not be included are being able to buy books, being able to read the books as it is a list and tracking, and it’s only going to be in English (We don’t speak “Insert language here”)
